# Oevyli

This is the repository of Oevyli language and compiler. Oevyli is a scripting language written in C.
Lua Language compiler and Crafting Inteterpreters were taken as references.

Note that it's under development. It started a frontend, backend compiler which has it's own IR.
But with the time constraints, I'll build the scripting language.
