Oevyli Language
---------------

Oevyli is a functional scripting language. Philosophy is to create 
something as simple dumb as possible. It's something like Haskell.

Haskell is not dumb!

How to use it
-------------
# On linux close the repo, execute build.sh (./build.sh). Go to bin/
directory and 
  * For REPL:  ./oevyli
  * To run your .oli file: ./oevyli <your .oli file>

Language
--------
# Create a function that multiply a number by itself and print it

print_simple_value.oli -------------------------------------------

var x = x * x
print var 3   ; should output 9. ';' is comments by the way.  
------------------------------------------------------------------

# Control flow

whats_my_score.oli -----------------------------------------------
; you can read this as 'what's my score Oli'

my_socre x
  | x > 75    = "A"
  | x > 65    = "B"
  | x > 55    = "C"
  | x > 35    = "D"
  | otherwise = "F"

print my_score 63 ; should output C
------------------------------------------------------------------

todo
----
* First I need the compiler that's fast and efficient.
* Create a debugger.
